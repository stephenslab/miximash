Description: This package implements a generalization of the Cormotif
    model (Y. Wei, T. Tenzen & H. Ji, 2015,
    <DOI:10.1093/biostatistics/kxu038>) for jointly analyzing
    differential gene expression in multiple studies, under multiple
    experimental conditions (e.g., measured in different cell
    types). Model fitting procedures are implemented using expectation
    maximizatino (EM).
